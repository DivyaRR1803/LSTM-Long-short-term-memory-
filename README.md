# Abstract

It presents a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing (NLP), involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of building a sentiment analysis model, starting from data preprocessing, through the use of embedding layers, to the implementation of an LSTM-based recurrent neural network. The goal is to leverage the capabilities of LSTM networks in capturing long-term dependencies in text data to accurately classify the sentiment of textual inputs.

# Objective

The primary objective of this is to guide users through the process of developing an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model. Specific objectives include:

1.Data Preprocessing: Demonstrate techniques for cleaning and preparing text data for modeling.

2.Embedding Layer: Explain the role of embedding layers in converting text data into numerical form suitable for input to neural networks.

3.LSTM Implementation: Provide a step-by-step guide to building and training an LSTM model for sentiment analysis.

4.Evaluation: Illustrate methods for evaluating the performance of the sentiment analysis model
